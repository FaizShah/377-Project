# Project Description 

The following website called 'Dirty Restrooms' offers reviews for restrooms at the University of Maryland, College Park. On the homepage of the website, users are able to click a building which then directs them to another page which lists all the restrooms in that building. Once a user then chooses a specific bathroom, they are able to see reviews that have already been submitted. Additionally on the same page, users can also submit new reviews which can then be aggregated to the already existing list of reviews.
